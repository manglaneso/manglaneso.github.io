Here's some software I use and recommend. I use some proprietary software on a daily basis, but every piece of software here is open source.

- **[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)**: Great to sync files among different devices.
- **[KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)**: A great password manager for all your sites.
- **[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)**: A completely underrated Bittorrent client.
- **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/new/)**: You know.
- **[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)**: An open source compilation of Visual Studio Code without the telemetry and tracking.
- **[OpenLens](https://github.com/MuhammedKalkan/OpenLens)**: An open source compilation of Lens.
- **[Okular](https://okular.kde.org/)**: An awesome PDF viewer by the KDE guys. It even runs on Windows.
- **[Filelight](https://apps.kde.org/es/filelight/)**: A great way to know what's eating up all your storage space. It even runs on Windows.
- **[Akregator](https://apps.kde.org/es/akregator/)**: A nice RSS client by the KDE guys. It even runs on Windows.
- **[QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org/)**: A simple note taking app.
- **[Terminator](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator)**: Multiterminal emulator.
- **[Meld](http://meldmerge.org/)**: File comparator.
- **[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/)**: An awesome media center.
