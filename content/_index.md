## Hi there!

I’m Andrés and this is my homepage :D

I’m a software engineer from Madrid, Spain who wanted/needed a personal site to write about the stuff I’m working on. I'm currently working as a backend engineer in [Devo](https://www.devo.com/).

Here's a [list of software]({{< ref "/software-recommendations.md" >}}) I use and recommend in case you are lookup for a change.
