This is a small G Suite Add-on for all the people, like me, who likes to keep track of the birthdays of their friends using Google Contacts.

### Why?

Google lets you store the birthdays of your contacts. Even they provide a built in calendar for you to check them in Google Calendar. The only problem is there are no notifications for this calendar.

That is where this Add-on can help you. Just switch on the service and start getting email notifications for your friends and colleagues birthdays.
