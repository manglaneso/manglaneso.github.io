I'm Andr√©s and this is my homepage :D

I'm a software engineer from Madrid, Spain who wanted/needed a personal site to write about the stuff I'm working on. Find here my projects, my (hopefully not so) rarely updated blog and my links to social media, Github and those kind of services.

I'll try to keep this site a WIP initial version, since I know it doesn't have many bells and whistles.

Also, since I am from Madrid, I may write some things in spanish, but I'll try to use english as my main language here.
